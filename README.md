# Project3-SentimentAnalysis

Have you ever read a tweet and thought, “Gee, what a positive outlook!” or
“Wow, why so negative, friend?” Can computers make the same
determination? They can surely try! In Machine Learning, the task of assigning a **label** to a data item is
called **classification** (putting things into different classes or
categories). The more specific name for what we’re going to do is
sentiment analysis because you’re trying to determine the “sentiment” or
attitude based on the words in a tweet. The goal of our project is to
build a sentiment classifier! 

Reading a set of tweets called the **training data set** that are
already pre-classified by humans as **positive** or **negative** based on
their content. We will analyze the frequency of occurrences of words in
the tweets to develop a classification scheme. Using our classification
scheme, we’ll then classify another set of tweets called the **testing
data set** and **predict** if each tweet has positive sentiment or
negative sentiment


**Objective:** 

* Practice the use of git and GitHub.
* Practice debugging and memory leak detection.
* Use of STL container (vectors, maps, etc.)
* Analyze the runtime complexity.
* Write a program with a command line interface.
* Design, implement, and test a small system.
* Create UML Diagram
* Practice project planning
